# Python Decision Making using Control Flow or Conditional Statements in Python:

'''
Decision making is anticipation of conditions occurring while execution of the program and
specifying actions taken according to the conditions.

Decision structures evaluate multiple expressions which produce TRUE or FALSE as outcome.

You need to determine which action to take and which statements to execute if outcome
is TRUE or FALSE otherwise.
