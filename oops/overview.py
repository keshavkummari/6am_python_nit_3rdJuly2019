1. class :

A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set
 of attributes that characterize any object of the class.

 The Attributes are data members (Class Variables & Instance Variables)
 and Methods, accessed via dot notation.

 1.1 Class Variable :
    A variable that is shared by all instances of a class.
    Class variables are defined within a Class but 
    outside any of the class's methods.
    Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are.
