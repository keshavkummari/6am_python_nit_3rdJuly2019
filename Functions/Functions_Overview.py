"""
A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action.

Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.

As you already know, Python gives you many built-in functions like print(), etc.
but you can also create your own functions.

These functions are called user-defined functions.

# Creating a function:

   "This prints a passed string into this function"
   print(b)
   

# Accesing the function:
